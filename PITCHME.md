#### FAQ: what is a penetration tester?

- security consultant
- security engineer
- hacker
- assessor
- (partial) auditor <- not precisely, but some overlap

---

#### FAQ: hacker!? isn't that illegal?

- it is only without authorisation
- clients want us to find vulnerabilities in their own system and not someone else's
- we do not only need their consent, but all related parties, that includes hosting companies

---

#### FAQ: so that's your job? breaking things?

- yeah, but not the entire time, we spend 50% hacking and another 50% reporting and giving advice to clients
- we do not just do web application or network pentests, we also do the following but not limited to:
  - mobile application
  - computer forensics
  - code review
  - social engineering, including phishing and physical testing

#### FAQ: doesn't that mean you need to know so many things?

- yes, absolutely, but no one can be good at everything
- that's why we work as teams
- we all should be more than capable of doing research and self-studying

#### Overview - Area

- web application
- network
- reverse code engineering

---

#### Web Application

- common vulnerabilities known as OWASP Top 10
- commonly written in PHP, Python, .NET, Java, and Ruby

Note:
hackers don't create the vulnerabilities, developers do, hackers only found them and make use of them.

#### Example vulnerable code - .NET

---

#### Network

- with short time frame, we only tend to check if they are using old versions of software
- normally can be detected with a simple banner grabbing
- real vulnerabilities commonly found with reverse engineering technique

---

#### Reverse Engineering

- the area is huge
- reverse software engineering involve disassembling

---

#### that's awesome! how can I be one?

- read a lot of books [http://dfir.org/?q=node/8]()
- root these machines [https://www.vulnhub.com]()
- be OSCP certified

- be a vimmer (optional)
